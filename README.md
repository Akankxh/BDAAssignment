# Frequent ItemSet Mining Using Apriori Algorithm

In this project we have worked on a dataset consisting of 77,185 places in the United States. 
Each line corresponds to the category list of one place, where the list consists of a number of category 
instances (e.g., hotels, restaurants, etc.) that are separated by semicolons.
