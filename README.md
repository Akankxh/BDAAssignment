# Frequent ItemSet Mining Using Apriori Algorithm

In this project we have worked on a dataset consisting of 77,185 places in the United States. 
Each line corresponds to the category list of one place, where the list consists of a number of category 
instances (e.g., hotels, restaurants, etc.) that are separated by semicolons.

Now, our motivation is to find out which category instances occur most frequently in places across the US, this is an example of a real-life data mining problem
and we have chosen the Apriori Algorithm because of its effectiveness in discovering frequent itemsets and association rules while working on large datasets.
It is commonly seen in Market Basket Analysis, Web Usage Mining and Recommendation Systems to identify association between products and increasing user
engagement.

The language used here is Python, libraries used are collections and itertools.
